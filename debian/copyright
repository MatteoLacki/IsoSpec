Upstream-Name: libisospec
Source: https://github.com/MatteoLacki/IsoSpec
Comment:
    The pristine upstream source contains Windows dll files and 
    other documentation files that are regenerated using doxygen.
    All these files are thereby not useful or appropriate for use as 
    source files. This violates DFSG §2.
    .
    The ‘debian/repack.sh’ program removes those files to create the Debian
    upstream source tarball.
