This file lists *major* changes between releases, for a full list see git log.

----------------------------------
HEAD

- Brought C++/Python examples up to the new API
- Small change of Python API 

----------------------------------
1.9.0a2

- Rudimentary module for backward-compatibility with IsoSpecPy 1.0.X API
- Bugfix (and usability improvement) for getting configurations in 
  IsoThreshold

----------------------------------
1.9.0a1

- Almost complete rewrite of the entire codebase
- Improvements in the core algorithms, resulting in 10x-1000x speed increase
  as well as lower memory consumption
- Reworked API to be more sensible
- Laying the groundwork for multithreaded operation (not complete yet)
- Expose generators in Python (enabling processing configurations on the fly,
  as they are produced without the need to compute and store all of them first
  (using up memory) and process them later)
- More modular Python part
- C/C++ and Python-only release, R will follow soon after
- Some features from 1.0.5 are not yet (re-)implemented: IsoLayered is only 
  exposed as a generator, not yet as a fixed table; as a consequence quicktrim
  to get the optimal p-set is still missing
- THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE: IT'S NOT YET EXHAUSTIVELY TESTED AND MAY CRASH OR 
  PRODUCE WRONG RESULTS
- API is still not yet finalized.

----------------------------------
1.0.7 (Python-only release)

- Bugfix in Python's getConfs()

----------------------------------
1.0.6 (Python-only release)

- Compatibility fixes for Python3.6

----------------------------------
1.0.4

- ??? FIXME

----------------------------------
1.0.3

- Only affecting IsoSpecR: improve the efficiency of R to C++ interface
- Add an option to skip discarding the superfluous configurations

----------------------------------
1.0.2

- Some further Python+Windows compatibility improvements

----------------------------------
1.0.1

- Only affecting IsoSpecPy: provide prebuilt library
