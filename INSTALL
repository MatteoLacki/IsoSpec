-------------------------------------------
Building and installing the C/C++ library

Requirements:
   A C++11 compiler, clang++ (v3.3 or later) or g++ (v4.7 or later)
   Make (GNU make is OK)


Note: clang++ is the default (and preferred) compiler as it produces 
faster code (in our tests, the difference in speed is about 20%). 
If you'd like to use g++ instead, please edit the first line of 
IsoSpec++/Makefile appropriately.

Next, execute the following commands:

cd IsoSpec++
make

You may copy the resulting .so file to a convenient location.
If you wish to develop software using this library, you will also 
have to place the header files (*.hpp/*.h) somewhere your C/C++
compiler can find them.


------------------------------------------
Building and installing the Python package

IMPORTANT: please note that the Python package is standalone, in the
sense that it does not need the C/C++ library to be installed separately.



Requirements:
    Python (obviously) (v2 and v3 are supported)
    C++11 compiler, clang++ (v3.3 or later) or g++ (v4.7 or later)
    setuptools
    cffi (this, if not present, will be automatically downloaded and
          installed by the setup script, however you may prefer to use 
          your distribution's package manager to install that)

Execute the following commands:
cd IsoSpecPy
sudo python setup.py install

Again, clang++ is the preferred compiler and will be used if found by the 
setup script. If you want to override the behaviour (if you have clang++ 
installed, but still want to use g++) you will have to replace the last 
command with:

ISO_USE_DEFAULT_CXX=TRUE sudo python setup.py install


------------------------------------------
Building and installing the R package
	
	A version of our software will be put on the Bioconductor server. 
	Before that, you can install the package by following these instructions. 

Requirements:
	R (>= 3.2.1)

Move to the folder containing the IsoSpecR folder. Then run in terminal:

	R CMD build IsoSpecR 
	R CMD INSTALL IsoSpecR_1.0.tar.gz  

All necessary packages should download automatically.
