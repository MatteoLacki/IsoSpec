-------------------------------------------
Building and installing the C/C++ library

Requirements:
   A C++17 compiler
   Make (GNU make is OK)


Next, execute the following commands:

cd src/IsoSpec++
make

You may copy the resulting .so file to a convenient location.
If you wish to develop software using this library, you will also
have to place the header files (*.hpp/*.h) somewhere your C/C++
compiler can find them.

------------------------------------------
Building and installing the Python package

IMPORTANT: please note that the Python package is standalone, in the
sense that it does not need the C/C++ library to be installed separately.

IsoSpecPy is compatible with both CPython and PyPy, running on Unix,
Cygwin or in MinGW environment.

The preferred method of installation is by using the pip package manager.
In order to do that, simply issue the following command, replacing
"<python>" with your Python executable (python/python3/pypy/...)

<python> -m pip install IsoSpecPy

If, instead, you wish to install the package manually, follow these
instructions:

Requirements:
    Python (obviously)
    C++17 compiler

Execute the following commands:
pip install .

------------------------------------------
Building and installing the R package

The preferred installation method is to use the CRAN package installer.
To do that, simply issue the command:

install.packages('IsoSpecR')

in your R session. However it is possible to install the package manually,
from source, by following these instructions:

Requirements:
	R (>= 3.2.1)
	Rcpp package from CRAN
	C++11 compiler, clang++ (v3.3 or later) or g++ (v4.7 or later)

Move to the folder containing the IsoSpecR folder. Then run in terminal:

   cd src
	R CMD build IsoSpecR
	R CMD INSTALL IsoSpecR_*.tar.gz

All necessary packages should download automatically.
